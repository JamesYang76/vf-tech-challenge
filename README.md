# VoiceFoundry Tech Challenges

Hey fellow coder!! ðŸ¤“

Here's a couple of challenges for you. Here's the process we can follow...

- **Branch** - Please pull the repo to your computer and checkout a new branch called <your-name> e.g. `john-smith`
- **Code** - Smash out some awesome code, comitting to this branch
    - If you do one or multiple challenges, you can submit it all in this one branch
- **PR** - When finished, create a [new pull request](https://bitbucket.org/voicefoundryau/vf-tech-challenge-1/pull-requests/new/), to merge your branch into master
    - After PR is created send us an email letting us know it's ready for review
- **Review** - We will review it, post some comments (suggestions/feedback) on the code and will send you an email when ready for you to address feedback
- **Tweaks** - Address the suggestions/feedback and let us know when ready for review again
- **Review** - We'll review again and suggest any more tweaks if needed
